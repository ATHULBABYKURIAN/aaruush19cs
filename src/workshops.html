                            different from each other? We all use vehicles as a means of getting to places but what exactly gets that engine

                            PUBG, Fortnite, Pokemon GO, you name it; they are definitely not foreign to our generation. Sometimes we may be so
                            immersed into games, where we find it hard to bring ourselves back into reality, and are lost in the virtual world
                            that
                            each game brings forth to us. With exciting visuals that mimic the real world, sound effects that bring so much more
                            thrill to the gaming experience, and the fact that more technology is yet to come to enhance our wishes to depart
                            from
                            reality, there’s no denying the fact that the gaming industry is here to take this generation by storm.
                            We present to you a collaboration by UNITY, NVIDIA, MSI. By joining this workshop, you’ll learn how these virtual
                            universes are made, and how it manages to capture the hearts of many every single time.
                            Gaming is a challenge.
                            But forming the game is an even bigger challenge.
